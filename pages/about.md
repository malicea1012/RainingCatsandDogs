**BLOOMINGTON ORDINANCE 21-45 AND ITS EFFECTS**

![Alt text] (obj9.jpg)

**You missed your chance to purchase a fur baby from your local Bloomington business.** On January 1, city council members passed an ordinance banning the sale of cats and dogs by retail pet stores. The ban has directly impacted local businesses. For example, Delilah’s Pet Shop has been open for over 40 years.

The ordinance was passed in a unanimous 8-0 vote in response to puppy mills, which are commercial dog breeding facilities that breed for profit. 

As most of the animals sold in pet stores are common animals from mills, Monroe County felt it best to decrease unethical animal breeding and selling. 

The issue regarding the buying and selling from puppy mills first arose when people began complaining about Anthony’s Pet Shop, another shop in town. Claims were made about the treatment of the animals and where the animals were coming from. The city decided to rule out unethical practices regarding retail shops selling animals. They agreed it would be best to ban all shops, including Delilah’s Pet Shop.

At the Humane Society, Virgil Sauder, one of the overseers, spoke out about how he feels this ordinance will decrease unethical practices. Sauder states, “The ban comes from a place of wanting to increase care standards. That said, shelters will never be able to supply the puppies that people need. It’s just not going to happen”. He believes, “Overall, it’s a step forward,” but it will not make much difference—so many people purchased from these proclaimed puppy mills shops, allowing these animals to gain families. 

Sauder claims that it will only increase the demand for animals, and often shelter animals cannot fit the needs of every person due to their developed behaviors, history, or age. He argues that puppies are an easy purchase for any family. Their personalities and behaviors are not fully developed, making the puppy adaptive to the family’s environment. 

This ordinance was placed to increase the ethical selling of animals within the city. Many people feel this ban on selling animals hurts local businesses and increases animal demand. Businesses, such as Delilah’s Pet Shop, must relocate. Therefore, the ordinance impacted more than what meets the eye at the surface level.
