This exhibition showcases the conditions of animals at both Anthony’s Pet Shop and Delilah’s Pet Shop. Since the passing of Bloomington City Ordinance 21-45, stating that no business should profit from the sale of animals, both companies have seen changes in different ways. Anthony’s has completely moved out of Bloomington and has continued selling puppies, and Delilah’s has reduced their stock to only pet-related items such as food and toys. 

Delilah’s has been family owned for over 35 years. In that time, they've been selling ethically bred puppies from local breeders. Owner Leslie Henderson Miller took over the family business in 2022 when her mother died. She has made it her mission to keep her family’s legacy alive. Unfortunately, this ordinance ruins that dream. Henderson Miller feels the ordinance has good intentions but harms her small business. She’s passionate about animals and their care, stating, “We were not trying to do anything wrong. We are trying to make sure the children we have to end up with the families they need,” She says, “It is good and bad in everything that you do. You have to find the bad and pull the bad out.” Miller Henderson exclaimed that it’s been hard to relocate, especially since the shop has such a good reputation in Bloomington. 

Anthony’s Pet Shop was located in the College Mall and started the concern for the treatment of animals in Bloomington stores. Claims were made that the animals were coming from unethical puppy mills. Since the ordinance, the owner has moved his store out of Bloomington and continues to sell puppies through Facebook.

Overall, the difference between Delilah’s and Anthony’s is the treatment and source of their animals. While Delilah’s Pet Shop prides itself on treating its animals while in their care, it took the blunt force of the ordinance drawback. The ordinance is for good in the long run but has affected small businesses.
