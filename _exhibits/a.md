**ORDINANCE 21-45 TO AMEND TITLE 7 OF THE BLOOMINGTON MUNICIPAL CODE ENTITLED "ANIMALS"
**
 - Re: Amending Chapter 7.01 (Definitions); Chapter 7.16 (Commercial Animal Establishment Permits); Chapter 7.54 (Fees); and Chapter 7.56 (Enforcement Procedure) WHEREAS, Title 7 of the Bloomington Municipal Code ("BMC") sets forth provisions regarding the care and control of animals through the Animal Care and Control Division of the Department of Public Works for the City of Bloomington; and 
WHEREAS, the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 10,000 puppy mills (both licensed and unlicensed) produce more than 2,600,000 dogs a year in the United States and that most pet shop dogs and cats come from puppy mills and kitten mills; and 
WHEREAS, according to the Human Society of the United States, the conditions endemic to puppy mills and kitten mills include over-breeding; inbreeding; minimal to nonexistent veterinary care; lack of adequate and nutritious food, water, and shelter; lack of socialization; lack of adequate space; and lack of adequate exercise; and 
WHEREAS, according to the Humane Society of the United States, the care and treatment of animals in puppy and kitten mill facilities can lead to health and behavioral issues in the animals kept and bred in those facilities, which may not present themselves until sometime after the purchase of the animals, and can lead to exorbitant financial and emotional costs on consumers; and 
WHEREAS, current Federal and State regulations do not properly address the sale of puppy and kitten mill dogs and cats in pet shops; and 
WHEREAS, BMC Title 7 does not currently include restrictions on the sale of dogs and cats at petshops;and 
WHEREAS, prohibiting the retail sale of dogs and cats is likely to decrease the demand for dogs and cats bred in puppy and kitten mills, and is likely to increase demand for animals from animal shelters and rescue organizations; and 
WHEREAS, across the country, thousands of independent pet shops as well as large chains operate profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not on the sale of dogs and cats. Many of these pet shops collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to offer space and support for showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises; and 
WHEREAS, this ordinance will not affect a consumer's ability to obtain a dog or cat of their choice directly from a breed-specific rescue organization or a shelter, or from a responsible breeder where the consumer can see directly the conditions in which the dogs or cats are bred, or can confer directly with the responsible breeder concerning these conditions; and 
WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the community as a whole and of the animals who reside here for the City of Bloomington to prohibit the sale of dogs and cats by pet shops.
